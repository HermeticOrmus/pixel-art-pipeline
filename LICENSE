GOLD HAT ADDENDUM

This software is released under the Gold Hat Philosophy:

  Build what elevates. Reject what degrades.

You are free to use this software for any purpose. We ask only that you
consider whether your use empowers or extracts from those it touches.

  - Does it respect user autonomy?
  - Does it operate transparently?
  - Does it elevate human dignity?

This addendum carries no legal weight. It is an invitation to consciousness.
